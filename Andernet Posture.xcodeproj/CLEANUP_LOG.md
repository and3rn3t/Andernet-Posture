# Workspace Cleanup - February 10, 2026

## Files Removed

The following documentation files were consolidated into README.md and removed to reduce clutter:

1. **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** (480 lines)
   - Verbose project structure documentation with flowcharts
   - Key information moved to README.md

2. **XCODE_CHECKLIST.md** (315 lines)
   - Step-by-step setup checklist
   - Useful once during initial setup, but not needed for daily development
   - Essential setup steps moved to README.md

3. **XCODE_SETUP_GUIDE.md** (571 lines)
   - Comprehensive Xcode configuration guide
   - Core configuration info consolidated into README.md

4. **XCODE_FILES_SUMMARY.md** (355 lines)
   - Summary of configuration files
   - Redundant with README.md project structure section

5. **SETUP_COMPLETE.md** (264 lines)
   - UI testing setup completion notice
   - Information merged into README.md testing section

**Total removed:** ~1,985 lines of documentation

## What Remains

- **README.md** - Comprehensive, streamlined documentation covering:
  - Quick start guide
  - Project structure
  - Testing (unit and UI tests)
  - Development configuration
  - Performance monitoring
  - Distribution
  - CI/CD
  - Troubleshooting

## Rationale

The removed files were:
- Overly verbose for ongoing development
- Contained significant overlap
- Primarily useful only during initial project setup
- Made the workspace harder to navigate

All essential information has been preserved in the consolidated README.md.
